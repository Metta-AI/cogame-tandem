## Tandem player: a policy is just a prompt.
##
## Connects to the game, delivers its registration in ONE Sprite v1 chat
## message, then idles until the socket closes. Every decision happens inside
## the game server, which sends this seat's prompt to Claude once every two
## seconds of sim time; a deterministic control layer turns the reply into a
## per-tick force vector at this cog's handle.
##
##   PLAYER_PROMPT=<strategy text>     -> an LLM seat
##   PLAYER_SCRIPTED=porter|mule       -> a scripted seat
##   (neither)                         -> PLAYER_SCRIPTED=porter
##
## To field your own policy, reuse this image and set PLAYER_PROMPT:
##   coworld upload-policy <tandem-image> --name my-tandem \
##     --run /bin/tandem-player --secret-env PLAYER_PROMPT="<your strategy>"

    ## THE CAP IS HERE, at the transport, because the Sprite v1 chat frame
    ## carries a u16 length: a registration over 65 535 bytes wraps that field
    ## and the server discards the frame, which silently turns a champion into
    ## a porter instead of truncating it. The design note's rule is that an
    ## over-long `register.prompt` is TRUNCATED, NEVER REJECTED, so it is cut
    ## here, on a rune boundary, before the frame is built. Mirrors
    ## `sim_types.MaxPromptRunes`, which caps it again server-side.

    ## and then exit with a clean message rather than a traceback. Comfortably
    ## longer than the game's board bake plus its container start, and well

    ## minutes of silence means the game pod is gone -- normally it closes the
    ## socket and the read returns, but a pod that dies without closing would
    ## otherwise leave this container blocked until the platform kills the
